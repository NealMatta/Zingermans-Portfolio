          <h2>Hi Jenn Hayman!</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Neal Matta and I am currently an intern working at
            SPARK Accelerator. I am working with TechStak to redevelop their
            website in hopes to decrease the bounce rate and increase the amount
            of customer follow throughs. A large part of the reason that I
            applied for SPARK was so that I could experience the versatility of
            working as a tech consultant through working with different companies.
            I created this website as a way to demonstrate some of the skills
            I’d be able to bring to the company. I am extremely interested in
            this opportunity to work with you and I hope you consider me as a
            candidate.
           </p>
           <br>

             I've attached my <a href="./documents/Neal_Matta_Resume.pdf">resume</a>
             and a PDF of the <a href="./documents/Job-Questions.pdf">job questions</a> for easier viewing.

              <li>Do you have at least 1 year experience in web design?</li>
              Yes

              <li>Rate your proficiency in HTML5 and CSS3</li>
              Advanced

              <li>Rate your proficiency in Illustrator and/or Photoshop</li>
              Advanced

              <li>Which of the following do you have proficient experience working with (check all that apply)</li>
              SASS, GIT, Twitter Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Sketch, Slack, Google Analytics, Mac OS

              <li>
                List any other technologies or languages you are proficient in
                that you feel would be a valuable contribution to this position.?
              </li>
              Lightroom CC, Node.JS, Express framework, Bootstrap

              <li>Please provide any links for us to view your web design work</li>
              The project that I'm most proud of is the website I made for the
              Michigan Bollywood Dance Team IZZAT. You can view the GitHub
              <a href="https://github.com/NealMatta/Michigan-Izzat-Website">here</a>.
              I keep some of my other notable projects on my website <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nealmatt/#portfolio">here</a>.

              <li>What do you enjoy most about being a web designer?</li>
              I enjoy the fact that every website I create will be different
              from the last. This simple fact alone allows me to constantly hone
              new skills, test my creativity, and learn new tools that I can
              apply to the next website I work on. I really enjoy the idea of
              applying everything I have learned regarding web design, while
              also really listening to and understanding the needs of who I am
              creating the website for. This creates a final product that is not
              only very much my own, but also caters to the unique, specific, and
              personal aspects of each website.


              <li>Why are you interested in this position?</li>
              I am interested in this position because I want to polish my
              Front-end skills. Independently I have had a lot of practice and
              am confident in my abilities to create. However, I would love to
              interact with web developers who have been doing this for an
              extended period of time and can give me valuable insight on
              techniques I can use to better my work.  I feel like u might
              wanna say something about why the company is cool or some shit
              but u don’t have to

              <li>At the end of the internship, what skills or kind of experience would you like to come away with?</li>
              I would ideally like to have more experience working as a web
              developer for non-tech companies in order to be a more versatile
              web designer, be more comfortable with Javascript, and ultimately,
              as I mentioned before, learn from and share ideas as much as I can
              with other developers.

              <li>When are you available to start working?</li>
            	 I would be able to start working immediately. I am also extremely
               open to continue the internship into the school year. Because, I
               attend the University of Michigan, I could easily commute to and
               from Zingermans if necessary.
